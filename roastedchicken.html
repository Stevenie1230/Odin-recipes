    <h3> This Roated Chicken recipe takes a little work, but it is so satisfying and filling that it's worth it!</h3>

    <p>I made up this one to resemble the rotisserie chicken I love so much. It is so expensive here, so here's my version.</p>

    <ul>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>

        <li>cooking spray</li>

        <li>1 whole chicken, cut into 8 pieces</li>

        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>

        <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>

        <li>1 teaspoon ground paprika</li>

        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>

        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>

    </ul>

        <ol>
            <h2>Step-By-Step:</h2>

             <li> Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch pan with cooking spray..</li>  

             <li> Arrange chicken pieces in the baking pan. Sprinkle salt, pepper, paprika, garlic powder, and oregano over both sides.</li>

             <li> Roast in the preheated oven until chicken is browned and the juices run clear, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>

        </ol>
